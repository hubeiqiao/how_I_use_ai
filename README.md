### [My Claude Code Workflow: How a Product Person Ships](https://ai.hubeiqiao.com/)

How I ship real products as a product person using Claude Code + Opus 4.5.

**TL;DR:**
1. Write what you want first — without AI
2. Use Plan Mode with `ultrathink` to break it down
3. Keep context window under control by compacting and using subagents
4. Test manually
5. When debugging, act like a PM and provide evidence

**Key Principles:**
- **Document First** — Articulate what you want before coding
- **Context Window** — Manage the 200K token limit; quality degrades as it fills
- **Manual Testing** — Your taste matters; ensure output matches YOUR expectations
- **Mindset** — Stay curious, ask questions, push back when something seems off

> *"The bottleneck is not AI's capability, it's your ability to articulate what you want."*
